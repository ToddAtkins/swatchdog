To install, simply issue the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	make realclean

Swatchdog installs just like a CPAN module. If you are not familiar with this 
process then you may want to read about it by issuing the command:

	man ExtUtils::MakeMaker

Use the "perldoc" command if your "man" cannot find the document.

If you see messages like these:

    Warning: prerequisite Date::Calc 0 not found at (eval 1) line 219.
    Warning: prerequisite Date::Parse 0 not found at (eval 1) line 219.
    Warning: prerequisite File::Tail 0 not found at (eval 1) line 219.
    Warning: prerequisite Time::HiRes 1.12 not found at (eval 1) line 219.

Then you need to install the CPAN module(s) that it doesn't find before 
you can use swatchdog. You can find these modules at search.cpan.org.
However, many operating systems may already bundle them up in neat
little packages, so you should check with them first.
