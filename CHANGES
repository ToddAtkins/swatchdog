  Fixed action parsing problem dealing with quotation marks.

  Fixed documentation on the '--restart-time' command line option.

  after the pattern was matched but was throttled. Credit goes
  to Rob Davies for bringing this to my attention.

  Changed building of throttled messages to replace characters that are cut
  out with a '_'

  Added date_loc, time_loc, and extra_cuts options to throttle.

  Fixed numerous problems with throttling

  Added --pid-file option.

  it can handle multiple actions of the same type within a single 
  watchfor block.

  every time the action is used unless this option is used.

  Changed keyword/value separation from '=' to whitespace, but
  will still handle the '=' sign for backward compatability.
  This was done in order to make the configuration file make more
  sense.

  /tmp, Swatchdog creates it in the user's home directory under the name
  .swatchdog_script.<PID>
